# Proj515-Alpha-Master
The master repository, to be deployed to the Alpha robot for testing. This repo contains the various packages developed by the team.

The robot will make use of the [ROS Navigation package](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation), which contains packages for costmaps, path planning and much more. The tutorial for [Setup and Configuration of the Navigation Stack on a Robot](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup) provides instructions for setting up the navigation stack on a custom robot, which requires platform specific nodes.
